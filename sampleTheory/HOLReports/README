1. Create as a SUBDIRECTORY in the folder containing your HOL script files
   a folder for your pretty-printed reports of HOL theories.  I name my
   folder HOLReports

2. In the HOLReports folder you must have the following:
   a. Holmakefile, which contains INCLUDES set to the locations of all
      the HOL theories you want to print out.  In this case it's the parent
      subdirectory ../
   b. holtexbasic.sty, which is found in your HOL installation subdirectory
      (search in /usr/local/share/HOL). LaTeX needs this file
   c. holtex.sty, also needed by LaTeX and found in your HOL installation
      subdirectory

3. The file documentation.sml is run by HOL and loads the theories you
   want to pretty-print.  It also loads the EmitTeX structure that
   defines the pretty-printing functions we need.
   a. The first time you write your own documentation.sml file, I
      suggest you execute it within HOL interactively to test it.

4. Makefile, which defines the scripts needed to delete old reports and
   recompile LaTeX files to build new reports.
   a. Note: the "clean" option in my Makefile assumes that all
      pretty-printed report names end with "Report". This way
      rm -f *Report.* effectively deletes all old reports.
   b. Note: HOL-generated LaTeX files that define LaTeX macros for
      each type definition, definition, and theorem in a theory start
      with "HOL". This way rm -f HOL*.* removes all old HOL-generated
      LaTeX files.
   c. If you're new to writing these scripts, try executing them
      line by line first to test them out.

5. Remember to execute Holmake in your parent subdirectory that contains
   the HOL source code script files.

6. Remember to do make clean to delete old reports prior to doing make.
   Otherwise, your new version of your reports will not be created because
   the pretty-printing functions will not overwrite old report files.
